# __AI RPG Game__

## About:

This is an AI (Artificial Intelligence) role-playing game (RPG). It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to make the story
 and add a few personalized touches to the game, and to import it, I use LangChain to help integrate it into my project. LangChain is a framwork or library for developing applications powered by language models, like GPT-4.

## How to Play: 

Here is a table displaying a few commands that you can do inside the game:

|Command      |About                                                                                                     |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`shop`       | The user enters into a store where they can buy things that they need using gold and sell things for gold|
|`attack`     | The user fights a hostile NPC (Non-Player Character) to get items and gold                               |
|`explore`    | The user has a 40% chance to gain a random amount, between 3 to 15 gold                                  |
|`talk`       | The user talks to a passive NPC which gives a gift, either an item, gold and/or advice                   |
|`inventory`  | The user checks their inventory to see what ites they have                                               |

There are subsidary commands in each one of them. For example, in the inventory section you can drop and pickup
 items and in the shop you can buy and sell items that you own. If you type anything that doesn't have a set
 command, the AI will give you more storyline or backstory.
