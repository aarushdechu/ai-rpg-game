Illuminated by your sputtering torch, the dark stone walls weep with condensation. A cold, damp draft brushes against your skin. As you step forward, your boots crunch against the gravel. The echo of your footfalls bounce off the jagged edges, the sound of loneliness ringing in your ears. A faint blue light paints an otherworldly hue on the cave's interior; the source, a set of 3 glowing runes carved into the stone, partially obscured by shadow. Each unique, intricate design emits a soft pulsating radiance that lures you towards it.\n\nFor your objective to activate all three runes, you have to figure out a way to approach each rune individually. A small, seemingly disorganized pile of stones sits ominously at the foot of the first rune. The second lies across the yawning chasm, just out of reach. And the third, so high up on the cavern wall that even squinting, you can barely make out its details.\n\nAs you go toward to examine the first rune, you notice a sudden movement out of the corner of your eye; something scuttles into the darkness. You follow the sound, trying to make sense of it. All seems quiet, until you feel a rumbling beneath your feet, as if the cave itself is alive... could this be the cave's guardian that the local folklore speaks of?\nUsed rune",
