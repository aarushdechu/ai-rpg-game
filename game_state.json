The echo of dissipating water droplets falling from stalactites is all you hear, a somber melody in this unknown place. You fumble through your satchel for something to shed light on your surroundings. You find a single torch, a beacon of hope in the encompassing darkness.\n\nAfter igniting the torch, the walls of the cave flicker with warm, dancing shadows. You can feel the cool, damp air against your skin and the rough stone under your feet.\n\nMovement in the torchlight reveals strange etchings on the surrounding walls. The inscriptions look almost ancient, delicate in detail yet imposing with some arcane purpose. It doesn't take long before you realize these are the glowing runes you seek to activate.\n\nAs you reach out and touch one of the runes, it glows bright blue for a moment then returns to a faint glow. A low rumble echoes around the cave, no doubt from something being activated deep within. You surmise that there are still two more runes needing activation.\n\nSuddenly, a chilling wind sweeps through the cavern, extinguishing your torch and leaving you in pitch-black darkness. From somewhere deeper in the shadows, you hear a guttural growl. Something knows you're here... Something isn't happy about it. Your adventure has just begun. It's time to find the other runes... and whatever was growling in the dark.\nEngaged in combat: fight something",
