    "game_history": "You woke up in a mysterious cave.\nstart game \u2192 As the player awakens in the heart of the eerie cave, a faint glow suffusing the darkness begins to take form. They squint their eyes; three distinct runic symbols, etched onto the cave walls, glisten in the ethereal light. First, a sprawling tree; tall, majestic. Second, an intricate flame; flickering, alive. Last, an enigmatic eye; watchful, knowing. No sunlight reaches into the cavern; the only source of light is the inner glow of these ancient runes, casting strange shadows on the rough stone floor.\n\nThe player intuitively realizes the purpose of their journey: find and activate these runes. But how? With no instruction or previous knowledge, this task feels as daunting as deciphering a forgotten language.\n\nIn their frostbitten hand, they clutch a single item: a torch. A potential source of light... and possibly something more?\n\nAs the player begins to explore the cave, the temperature suddenly, inexplicably drops. A cold wind whistles through the cavern, whipping the player's torch flame into a wild dance. The hostile environment seems keen on snuffing out their only source of physical light.\n\nThe torch is their sole reminder of the world above, their guiding star in the stygian depths. It\u2019s a beacon of hope, but also a source of desperation - the torch is a dwindling resource that could extinguish at any moment. They must use it wisely to survive.\n\nWith no NPCs in the vicinity yet, the player is truly alone in this dark adventure. It's just them, the runes, and the swirling shadows. The echo of their own footsteps is their only company. Despite the isolation, the player might find themselves feeling watched...\n\nStrange noises echo through the dim tunnels, sending invisible ripples bouncing off the walls. The echoes sound eerily like whispers... or is it just the wind? The cave seems to be playing tricks on them.\n\nThey'll need to decode the language of this ancient civilization and awaken the powers slumbering within the enigmatic runes. The path ahead is shrouded with darkness, teeming with unseen threats and desperate hopes.\n\nThe journey begins.",
